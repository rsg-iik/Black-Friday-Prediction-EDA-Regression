# Black-Friday-EDA-Prediction
The dataset here is a sample of the transactions made in a retail store. The store wants to know better the customer purchase behaviour against different products. 
Specifically, here the problem is a regression problem where we are trying to 
predict the dependent variable (the amount of purchase) with the help of the information contained in the other variables.
